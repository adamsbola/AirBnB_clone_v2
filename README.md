<center> <h1>AirBnB clone - MySQL</h1> </center>

This repository contains the third stage of a student project to build a clone of the AirBnB website. This stage implements a MySQL database storage to manage program data by transitioning from the file storage initially used in the initial stage using object relational mapping to switch between the realational database and file storage system.
